This WordPress plugin is for running a hockey community site that manages leagues, tournaments and player stats in a very flexible, real-world way. The core idea is that it should sit on top of existing WordPress user accounts for players, and then add hockey-specific structure around them: teams, seasons, tournaments, events, games and stats. It should not behave like a rigid “official league” system with strict assumptions. Instead, it needs to handle a messy, unstructured environment where players can bounce between multiple teams, tournaments and roles without the plugin blocking anything with artificial constraints.

Player accounts already exist at the WordPress level (as users), so the plugin’s job is to link those users to “player profiles” and then to all the hockey entities. A single player can be on multiple teams, in multiple tournaments, within the same season, and that must be fully supported. There should be no global rules like “player A is on team A, so they cannot also be on team B.” The data model needs to explicitly allow many-to-many relationships: one player can belong to many teams, and each team can have many players; one player can participate in many tournaments, and tournaments can have overlapping rosters. At the same time, the plugin must clearly separate what belongs to a team, what belongs to a player, and what belongs to a specific game or event.

To support this, the plugin will define custom database tables (instead of trying to cram everything into posts and meta). There will be tables for players (linked to WordPress users), teams, seasons, tournaments, games, events/meetings, and stats entries. Stats should always be attached to a game and a team, and then reference a player from that context. In practice, a stats row might say: “for game X, team Y, player Z had these numbers.” This keeps stats grounded in the team context, but still makes it easy to roll them up by player across multiple teams and tournaments. Anything that is team-specific (like lineups, captaincy, or jersey numbers within that team) should live on the team–player relationship, not on the player globally.

Because this is a very unstructured group, jersey numbers and similar attributes must be flexible. A player might have a “default” number in their main profile, but that should be optional. The system needs to let them wear a different number for a particular team, or even change numbers for a specific game if needed. The plugin should not assume one permanent jersey number per player. Instead, it can store a general “preferred number” on the player, an override on the team–player record, and, if necessary, a final override on the game lineup. The guiding principle: always record what actually happened in that game with that team, and never block entry because it doesn’t match some predefined global rule.

Events and meetings are also part of this ecosystem. The plugin should be able to store “non-game” events like practices, meetings, drafts, social nights, and tournaments schedules, again in their own table. These events can be attached to a team, a league, a tournament, or just the general community. Attendance or participation can be tracked at the player level if desired, but that should be optional. The main point is to provide a central way to list and manage all the key dates and gatherings that surround the hockey activity, not just the actual games.

Overall, the plugin’s philosophy is: model the real world as it is, not as a perfectly organized league office thinks it should be. Players can appear in weird combinations, teams can be thrown together for a single tournament, and rosters can change constantly. The data model must remain consistent and clean, but the rules should be minimal. If something belongs logically to a player, it goes on the player profile. If it belongs to a team roster, it goes on the team–player link. If it belongs to a particular game, it goes on the game or the game–player stats. With that structure in place, the plugin can later provide clean interfaces for entering scores, viewing leaderboards, showing player histories across teams, and displaying tournament standings, all without ever assuming a strict one-team-per-player setup.

The final goal of this overview is to give an AI (or a developer) a clear mental model of how the plugin should behave: a WordPress plugin that defines its own custom tables and relationships, plugs into existing user accounts, and prioritizes flexibility in how players, teams, tournaments and stats are linked together, so that it can support a chaotic, community-driven hockey scene without getting in the way.
